We can also see a difference between bacteria and viruses in their size. Bacteria are usually 0.2 to 2 micrometres in size while viruses are 10-100 times smaller than bacteria."
"How does the human circulatory system function?","Your circulatory system relies on the coordinated function of blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries, working in conjunction with your heart and lungs to ensure the continuous circulation of blood throughout your body. The process begins with the right ventricle of the heart pumping oxygen-poor blood into the lungs through the pulmonary trunk. Within the lungs, blood cells acquire oxygen, becoming oxygenated. The oxygenated blood then travels back to the heart through the pulmonary veins, entering the left atrium and subsequently passing into the left ventricle. From there, the left ventricle propels the oxygenated blood out to the body through a network of arteries. As the blood traverses your body and organs, it transports and delivers essential nutrients, hormones, and removes waste products. Deoxygenated blood, along with carbon dioxide, is collected by veins and returned to the heart, which then pumps it back to the lungs. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is expelled as you exhale, completing the circulation process. This continuous cycle ensures the delivery of oxygen and nutrients while facilitating the removal of waste products throughout your body."
"What are the major causes of water pollution?","Causes of water pollution include - industrial waste, household waste, waste water, nuclear waste, oil pollution, animal dung, pesticides, etc. "
"How does the human reproductive system work?","In the human reproductive process, two kinds of sex cells, or gametes, are involved. The male gamete, or sperm, and the female gamete, the egg or ovum, meet in the female's reproductive system to create a baby. Both the male and female reproductive systems are essential for reproduction."
"What are the effects of global warming on the polar ice caps?","Ice is melting at the poles. Impacts will be global. Ice shelves are massive, floating platforms of ice that surround the ice-covered continents of Antarctica and Greenland. When they melt, sea level isn't directly affected because this ice is already in the ocean."
"How do solar panels convert sunlight into electricity?","Simply put, a solar panel works by allowing photons, or particles of light, to knock electrons free from atoms, generating a flow of electricity, according to the University of Minnesota Duluth. Solar panels actually comprise many, smaller units called photovoltaic cells — this means they convert sunlight into electricity. Many cells linked together make up a solar panel."
"What is the impact of social media on society?","Social media has both positive and negative impacts on society1. Some of the positive outcomes include socialization and communication, enhanced learning opportunities, and accessing health-related information12. On the other hand, some of the negative impacts include depression, anxiety, catfishing, bullying, terrorism, and criminal activities1. Social media has changed the way we socialize, conduct our businesses, engage in political affairs, build professions, and set job recruitments3. Social media has also created a decentralized communication channel and opened the door for all to have a voice and participate2"

"How does the human skeletal system support the body?","The skeletal system is made up of your bones and creates the support structure for the rest of your tissue and organs12. It gives your body shape, supports your muscles, provides movement, and protects your internal organs12. It also stores minerals and fat, and produces blood cells123. The skeletal system works with tendons, joints, ligaments, and muscles to produce various movements3."
"How does the process of fermentation work?","Fermentation is a natural process through which microorganisms like yeast and bacteria convert carbs into alcohol or acids123. The alcohol or acids act as a natural preservative and give fermented foods a distinct zest and tartness. Fermentation also promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria, known as probiotics1. In fermentation, the only energy extraction pathway is glycolysis, with one or two extra reactions tacked on at the end4"

"How do vaccines work to prevent diseases?","Vaccines can help protect against certain diseases by imitating an infection. This type of imitation infection, helps teach the immune system how to fight off a future infection. Sometimes, after getting a vaccine, the imitation infection can cause minor symptoms, such as fever. "
"How does the human excretory system remove waste from the body?","The excretory system plays a crucial role in eliminating waste from the body through a series of steps. The first step is filtration, where blood enters the nephrons, which are specialized structures in the kidneys responsible for filtering out impurities. During filtration, waste products and excess substances are separated from the blood. The next step is reabsorption, where the remaining blood, free from impurities, is reabsorbed through capillary walls, ensuring essential nutrients and substances are retained in the bloodstream. Simultaneously, the impurities, along with excess water, move through tubules. Lastly, the process of excretion takes place. The urine, consisting of the filtered waste products, travels from the kidneys through the ureters and collects in the urinary bladder, where it is stored until it is released from the body through the urethra. The urinary tract, including the kidneys and associated structures, forms a vital component of the excretory system. The kidneys utilize nephrons to filter waste materials and produce urine, which serves as the means for eliminating urea, salts, and excess water from the body. Through these intricate processes, the excretory system helps maintain the body's internal balance by removing waste products and regulating fluid levels."
"What are the effects of air pollution on human health?","On an individual level, air pollution causes the following effects on human health. Cardiovascular disease; One of the emerging risk factors for stroke is air pollution. This is especially true in developing countries like India, where air pollution is rampant. Lung Diseases"
